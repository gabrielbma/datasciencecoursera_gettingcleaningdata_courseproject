=====================================================

This project is responsible for cleaning the data set from: 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

You should first download the following required data set and extract it into the same folder where run_analysis.R is placed.

So, to run the run_analysis.R, you should:

 1 - Download the dataset from:
     https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
     
 2 - Extract it into the the directory where run_analysis.R is placed.
 
 3 - source('run_analysis.R')
 
 4 - As a result, you should see two files containing the processing result. The first one called tidydataset1.txt contains only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. The second one called tidydataset2.txt contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
